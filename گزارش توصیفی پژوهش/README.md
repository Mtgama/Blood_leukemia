# Predicting Five-Year Survival in Pediatric Leukemia Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project investigates factors associated with five-year survival among pediatric leukemia patients using machine learning models. The goal is to identify significant predictors and develop predictive models to support clinical decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze demographic and clinical variables مرتبط با بقای پنج‌ساله
- Compare performance of multiple machine learning models
- Identify key prognostic factors influencing survival

## Dataset
The dataset includes clinical and demographic features of pediatric leukemia patients.  
Target variable: **Five-year survival outcome (Binary classification)**

> Note: Patient data is anonymized and used strictly for research purposes.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Feature selection / importance analysis
- Model training and evaluation:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

## Results
The comparative analysis demonstrates that ensemble-based models achieved superior predictive performance. Feature importance analysis highlights clinically relevant survival factors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Future Work
- Incorporating deep learning models
- External validation on independent datasets
- Deployment as a clinical decision-support tool
